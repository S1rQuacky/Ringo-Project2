## ** Spooktober Watchlist**
The spooky season is here, time to binge your horrorfest movies. If you are like me, you enjoy watching horror flicks during the month of October especially since most streaming services have more horror options. And if you are like me, you lose track or forget what movies you have seen, which ones you liked, which ones you can go without and which ones have been suggested to you. Spooktober Watchlist will help you keep your spooky movies in order so you do not waste time with the ones you do not like or have already seen. Create your own account and start your spooky list now.
