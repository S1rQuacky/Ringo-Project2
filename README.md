## ** Spooktober Watchlist**
The spooky season is here, time to binge your horrorfest movies. If you are like me, you enjoy watching horror flicks during the month of October especially since most streaming services have more horror options. And if you are like me, you lose track or forget what movies you have seen, which ones you liked, which ones you can go without and which ones have been suggested to you. Spooktober Watchlist will help you keep your spooky movies in order so you do not waste time with the ones you do not like or have already seen. Create your own account and start your spooky list now.

![future landing](img/2021-10-13-21-59-36.png)
I will be linking a Movie Database API so that users without an account can browse through different horror/thriller movies. 
I will be adding a search function and for users with an account, they will be able to add a movie to their watch list. 
The user will be able to add their notes and rating, but the title, overview, release date and poster will be populated by the API. 

I have plans to add more CSS and a nav bar.
